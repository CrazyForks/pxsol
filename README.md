# Python SDK for SOL

Python SOL is an experimental project that aims to provide human-friendly interfaces for common SOL operations. Note that Python SOL is not a complete SDK, but only implements the SOL functions that I am interested in.

Features:

- No third-party dependencies. All code is visible.
- Incredibly simple.

## Installation

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/mohanson/pysol
$ cd pysol
$ python -m pip install --editable . --config-settings editable_mode=strict
```
